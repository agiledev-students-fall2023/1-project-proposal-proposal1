# Project Proposal 1

### Project title
NYC Rental Hub
### What and why?
I want to create a website that aggregates rental information in New York City and the surrounding areas. When I was searching for a rental myself, I contacted several real estate agents, and the rental information they provided was extensive and disorganized, making it challenging to compare apartments in different areas. With this website, we can manually input property information and perform various comparisons, such as categorizing by location, sorting by price, and filtering by property type, and more.
### For whom?
Primarily targeting anyone looking to rent in New York City, especially international students who are new to the city. They may not be familiar with the local situation, and having a statistical website can better assist them in finding apartments that suit their needs.
### How?
Users can select options such as room type, orientation, location, and whether the property is shared with others when creating a new property listing. These options are provided by the website and cannot be manually input by users. Users can input the rental price and add any additional notes. They can also upload useful images, such as floor plans. After creating the listing, users can filter by room type, orientation, location, and whether it's shared, and then sort the results by price. Additionally, the website can utilize APIs from external sources to provide additional useful information.
### Scope
This proposal would be suitable for a group of approximately 4-6 programmers to undertake in one semester. Creating an effective database and designing a user-friendly interface are crucial steps, and they may require a significant amount of time.
